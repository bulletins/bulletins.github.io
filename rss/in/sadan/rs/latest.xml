(c)       	The purpose of education is to bring out a good human being out of the system. For real development along with knowledge, Life Skill education, value education, physical education, experiential learning is essential. Creative skills need to be nurtured. It was demand from all stakeholders that because of heavy curriculum, there is no time left for all these aspects. Also rote learning is not the way forward. Therefore, School Syllabus must be rationalized. To achieve this, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has been advised to undertake an exercise to review its syllabus with a view to reducing the curriculum load on the students.  They have conducted a workshop in this regard and have come out with following plan of action for reducing the Curriculum burden:  1.	Analysis of NCERT’s syllabi and textbooks across subject areas and classes focusing on the following:a.	Learning outcomes.b.	Curriculum linkages across classes and subjectsc.	Overlapping in the content (science and geography; physics and chemistry, etc.)d.	Comprehensibility of languagee.	Age-appropriateness of the contentf.	Diverse contexts2.	Inviting suggestions from teachers, students, parents and other stake holders through web portal on the reduction of curriculum load. 3.	Developing framework for Experiential Learning through mapping of curricular concepts, life skills and values for holistic development of children. NCERT have invited suggestions from various stakeholders in this regard. *****</description>

Accordingly, as per Rule 2 of the Central Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1972, as amended on 30.12.2003, these rules are applicable to Government servants appointed to civil  posts on or before 31.12.2003. The date on which the vacancies arose or the date on which the examination was conducted for filling up the vacancies is not relevant for deciding the applicability of the Central Civil Services (Pension) rules, 1972.Ministry of Home Affairs have not sought any advice from Department of Pension and Pensioners’ Welfare on the question of having a policy to cover the paramilitary personnel appointed after 01.01.2004 under the  Old Pension Scheme on the ground that the vacancies arose, or the examination was conducted, in the year 2003. However, a reference was received from Ministry of Home Affairs in a specific case relating to appointments as Sub-Inspector in various Central Para Military Forces after selection in August, 2003 on the basis of an Examination conducted in 2002. Appointments on the basis of these selections were made in Central Reserve Police Force in 2003 and the candidates appointed were covered by the pension scheme under Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1972. However, in the Border Security Force, offers of appointment on the basis of the same examination/selection were issued in January, 2004. On a petition filed by some personnel appointed in the Border Security Force on the basis of that examination, Hon’ble High Court of Delhi directed to cover the petitioners under the Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules, 1972 on the grounds of administrative delay on the part of Border Security Force in making appointments. The order of Hon’ble High Court of Delhi was implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs/Border Security Force in view of the peculiar circumstances of that case. The decision taken in that case is, however, not relevant for deciding applicability of Central Civil Service (Pension) Rules to all appointments made on or after 01.01.2004 in the Central Para Military Forces or in any other Department/organization on the basis of year of examination/selection. ******</description>

It is not true that there has been leakage of Question Paper and corruption on a very large scale in various examinations conducted by the SSC through private agencies.During the conduct of Combined Graduate Level (Tier-Il) Examination, 2017 in February-March, 2018, there have been some allegations of cheating and leakage of Answer Keys of	 some Questions of Paper-I on 21.02.2018.With the aim to reaffirm the faith of candidates in examination process of SSC, the Government on the recommendation of SSC has requested CBI to enquire into the allegations.******</description>

      <title>Data related to Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs)</title>
      <link>http://164.100.158.235/question/annex/246/Au300.pdf</link>
      <description>Data related to Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs)300Shri      Majeed Memon                            Will the Minister of																TRIBAL AFFAIRS   be 																pleased to state :-															(a) whether there is no national level data on implementation of Forests Right Act for Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (OTFDs); (b) the number of titles received and their rejection rates, by STs and OTFDs; (c) the manner in which the Ministry proposes to clear the roadblocks such as low priority for State machinery, lack of awareness and misinformation, intrasociety dynamics, lack of agency for OTFDs, lack of transparency and ineffective documentation for OTFD inclusion; and (d) the steps taken by Government to ensure representation of OTFDs in village level institutions?ANSWER  (a) and (b) 	The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (in short, Forests Right Act, 2006) seeks to recognize and vest the forest rights and occupation in forest land in forest dwelling STs and OTFDs who have been residing in forests for generations.  The forest rights enumerated in Section 3(1) of Chapter- II of this Act do not make distinction between STs and OTFDs.  Hence, the Act itself does not necessitate maintenance of segregated data for STs and OTFDs. As per the information received from States/UTs, upto 28.02.2018, a total of 18,52,490 titles have been recognized and 19,36,083 have been rejected under Forest Right Act.(c) 	Right from the time of promulgation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Rights) Act, 2006 and Rules thereunder, Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) has been providing support to States and UTs for effective implementation of the Act besides guiding them and hand holding and monitoring its implementation. A brief account of such steps taken by MoTA is furnished in Annexure.(d)	Under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, the only authority/institution at village level is the Gram Sabha which is to initiate the process for determining the nature and extent of individual or community rights or both that may be given to the forest dwelling STs and OTFDs within the local limits of its jurisdiction under this Act.  Further, in terms of Section 2(g) of the Act ‘Gram Sabha’ means a village assembly which shall consist of all adult members of a village with full and unrestricted participation of women.  Since the Act itself provides that all adult members of a village with full and unrestricted participation of women shall be members of ‘Gram Sabha’, hence representation of OTFDs in village level institutions for Forest Rights Act is already ensured.**** Annexure Steps taken by Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) for effective implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (in short FRA, 2006)1.      Support provided by MoTA to State GovernmentsA.       Capacity Building to States / UTsi.

Letters written on 27.7.2015 to States with high rates of rejection of claims, following which they have started reviewing and re-examining the rejected claims.  	On 21.9.2017, letter sent to States to use space technology for creation of geo-referenced database on vesting of rights/ correction of record of rights, for convening Gram Sabhas meeting, suo-motto review of rejected claims and early disposal of all pending claims.3. 	Overall ImpactOverall rejection rate has declined from 55% to 51% and sustained campaigning has led to increase in number of claims filed from 32,36,539 in October 2012 to 42,10,652 in January 2018.****</description>

STATEMENT REFERRED TO IN REPLY TO PARTS (A) TO (D) OF RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. 23 FOR 19.07.2018 ASKED BY CH. SUKHRAM SINGH YADAV, HON’BLE MEMBER OF PARLIAMENT, REGARDING DISSOLUTION OF UGC(a) &amp; (b): The Ministry has prepareda draft Higher Education Commission of India Bill, 2018 for repeal of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act and setting up Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) for promoting the quality of academic instruction, maintenance of academic standards and autonomy of higher educational institutions for free pursuit of knowledge, innovation, incubation, skills and entrepreneurship, and for facilitating access, inclusion and opportunities to all, and providing for comprehensive and holistic growth of higher education and research in a competitive global environment. (c): At the time of establishing the UGC, total number of Higher Educational Institutions were very small in number in the country. There were only 20 universities and nearly 500 colleges with a total enrolment estimated to be 0.21 million. Over the last six decades the size, scale and complexities of India’s Higher Education Sector has increased manifold and it is now considered to be one of the largest Higher Education Systems in the world with over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges, both in public and private sector. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in the country is at 25.2% with a total enrolment estimated to be about 35.7 million.  With the increase in number of Higher Educational Institutions, the expert committees such as Hari Gautam Committee recommended that the regulator should focus on promotion of quality teaching and research and usher measures to bring the much needed reforms in the higher education sector. The draft HECI Bill now proposes to enable the Commission to perform its role effectively in attaining standards and enhancing quality in higher education.The grant disbursal function to Universities and Colleges is now proposed to be located in an entity which works in a transparent, merit-based approach through an ICT enabled platform. The proposed Higher Education Commission of India will focus largely on promoting the quality of academic instruction, maintenance of academic standards and grant of autonomy of higher educational institutions. Further, the HECI will have powers to enforce compliance to quality standards and to order closure of substandard, bogus and fake institutions. (d): The focus of HECI will be on improving academic standards and the quality of higher education. The transformation of the regulatory set up is now proposed to be guided by the following principles:i.	downsizing the scope of the regulations;ii.	no more interference in the management issues of the educational institutions;iii.	the grant disbursal function to Universities and Colleges is proposed to be located in a separate entity based on transparent, merit-based approach through a technology enabled platform;iv.	the HECI would focus only on academic matters;v.	regulation would be done through transparent public disclosures, merit-based decision making on matters regarding standards and quality in higher education;vi.	theHECI will be tasked with the mandate of improving academic standards with specific focus on learning outcomes, evaluation of academic performance by institutions, mentoring of institutions, training of teachers, use of educational technology etc;vii.	it will develop norms for setting standards for opening and closure of institutions, provide for greater flexibility and autonomy to institutions, lay standards for appointments to critical leadership positions at the institutional level irrespective of University started under any Law;viii.	it will have powers to enforce compliance to the academic quality standards and will also have the power to order closure of sub-standard and bogus institutions.Further, the Ministry has put the draft Higher Education Commission of India Bill, 2018 in public domain on 27.06.2018 for seeking comments and suggestions from educationists, stakeholders and general public before 20.07.2018. As on 15thJuly, 2018, 7529 suggestions/comments covering Members of Parliament, State Governments, academicians, teacher unions, Chambers of Commerce, students etc. have been received and appropriate changes are being made in the final draft based on public feedback.  ******</description>

The Government has clear and consistent position that it desires normal neighbourly relations with Pakistan, and is committed to addressing all outstanding issues bilaterally and peacefully in accordance with the Simla Agreement and the Lahore declaration. However, any meaningful dialogue can be held only in an atmosphere free from terror, hostility and violence. The onus is on Pakistan to create such a conducive atmosphere.Continued cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan remains a core concern for us. India has repeatedly called upon Pakistan to abide by its commitment not to allow any territory under its control to be used for terrorism against India in any manner. Pakistan has also been asked to take effective actions to end terrorism and dismantle terrorist sanctuaries and infrastructure on the territory under its control. Until such time, India will continue to take firm and decisive steps to respond to cross-border terrorism. *****</description>

However, so far, none of these bills have been passed. 	On the Executive side, on 18 April 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order (EO) titled "Buy American and Hire American”, which requires different arms of the U.S. Administration to suggest reforms to the H-1B visa programme. This process is still underway and no comprehensive changes have been made. The U.S. Administration has taken some steps towards stricter enforcement and prevention of abuse of the work visa programmes.(c) &amp; (d) 	 Government of India has closely engaged with the U.S. Administration and the Congress at all levels on all issues relating to movement of Indian professionals, including those pertaining to the H-1B visa and L-1 Visa programme. In our engagements, we have emphasized that this has been a mutually-beneficial partnership which should be nurtured. Indian skilled professional have contributed to the growth and development of the U.S. economy and have helped the U.S. retain its competitive edge and innovation advantage. *****</description>

      <description>Abduction of Indian fishermen193Shri      Lal Sinh Vadodia                        Will the Minister of																EXTERNAL AFFAIRS be 																pleased to state :-															(a) whether cases of abducting Indian fishermen and capturing their boats has come to light;(b) if so, whether Government has taken any steps, so far, in this regard; and(c) if so, the details thereof and if not, the reasons therefor?ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD)](a) &amp; (b)	There is no information about any abduction of Indian fishermen. However, from time to time, Indian fishermen have been arrested by Sri Lankan and Pakistani authorities for allegedly fishing in their territorial waters. As on 18 July 2018, there are 2 Indian fishermen and 177 Indian fishing vessels in Sri Lankan custody. As per available information, currently there are 418 fishermen who are Indian or believed to be Indian and more than 1050 Indian fishing boats in Pakistan’s custody. However, Pakistan does not acknowledge the number of boats of Indian fishermen in their custody. (c) &amp; (d)	Government of India attaches the highest priority to the safety, security and welfare of Indian fishermen. Government regularly takes up the matter of apprehension of Indian fishermen and their fishing boats with the Governments of Sri Lanka and Pakistan for their early release. With Sri Lanka, the fishermen issues have been raised at the highest level including by the Prime Minister and the External Affairs Minister. Following the 2+2 initiative in November 2016 when the Foreign and Fisheries Ministers of the two countries met in New Delhi, a bilateral Joint Working Group (JWG) mechanism was institutionalized to address the fishermen issues with Sri Lanka. It was also agreed that Ministers for Fisheries of the two countries meet every six months to review the progress. As a result of sustained diplomatic efforts, Government has so far secured the release of 2329 fishermen and 288 boats from Sri Lankan custody since 2014. Government continues to take various measures to diversify our fishermen from the ecologically unsustainable method of bottom trawling to deep sea fishing using tuna long-liners. Government has initiated the “Assistance for Deep Sea Fishing” scheme to support the fishermen in this pursuit. Prime Minister had unveiled the scheme in the Palk Bay area in July 2017. Several batches of fishermen have been trained so far in deep-sea fishing, long-lining and onboard handling and processing of fish. The High Commission of India in Islamabad, on a continuing basis, provides humanitarian and legal assistance to Indian nationals imprisoned in Pakistan, including regular distribution of items of daily necessity to them through Pakistani jail authorities. As a result of persistent efforts, Government has secured the release and repatriation of 1699 Indian fishermen and 57 Indian fishing boats from Pakistan since 2014. *****</description>

ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD)](a) to (d) 	Grant of citizenship to foreign nationals is a long and continuous process and it is understood that there would be a considerable number of applications for grant of citizenship, made by PIOs and NRIs, pending before the authorities of the foreign governments. As grant of citizenship to foreign nationals is a sovereign function of the host country and owing to strict privacy laws in most of the countries, the number of such pending requests cannot be ascertained.Given the fact that grant of citizenship to foreign nationals is a prerogative of the host Government, there is a limited scope to extend support to the PIOs and NRIs in this regard. However, Indian Missions/Posts abroad extend all necessary consular services and support to the PIOs and NRIs when approached with proper documentation. These services include, among others, cancellation of Indian passport, issuance of surrender certificate and necessary attestation of documents that originated in India. The Ministry takes up consular issues with the foreign governments on a regular basis through various mechanisms including bilateral talks and consular dialogues. *****</description>

Sarojini Hembram                        Will the Minister of																EXTERNAL AFFAIRS be 																pleased to state :-															(a) 	what are the measures taken, so far, to further simplify the process of applying and obtaining Passports by the citizen of our country; and(b) 	the details of new rules framed or likely to be framed as a part of Passport Revolution for the benefits of the people?ANSWER  THE MINISTER OF STATE IN THE MINISTRY OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS[GEN. (DR) V. K. SINGH (RETD)](a) 	The Ministry has eased the passport issuing process and has made it an online procedure including getting appointments for submission of documents for passports. Effective technical infrastructure is in place to ensure that the Passport Seva system is available for access at all times from any location. The Passport Portal (www.passportindia.gov.in) is accessible to anyone, anywhere and anytime. With a view to address the challenge of digital divide, especially in the rural hinterland, the Ministry in association with CSC e-Governance Services India Ltd. (which is promoted by the Department of Electronics and IT), has facilitated online filing of passport applications, through the vast network of Common Service Centres (CSCs) across rural hinterland. An applicant can now apply for a passport from anywhere in India. But Police verification would be conducted by the Police Station in whose jurisdiction the address mentioned in the form falls and the passport will also be dispatched at the same address.mPassport Seva mobile app enables to apply, pay and schedule appointments for passport services. This App is available in Android and iOS platforms. It also provides passport related information including PSK and POPSK locator, applicable fees, mode of submission, and tracking of passport application status on smart phones. Citizens would not require access to a computer and printer to apply for passport services. Securing online appointments for submission of passport applications at PSK/ POPSK has been simplified. The current provision is allowing applicants to choose any appointment date from the earliest five available dates (working days) for scheduling/ rescheduling an appointment for passport related services. Earlier, the System used to offer only one available date to the applicant for seeking appointment for passport related services.  	The Ministry has expanded the outreach by opening PSK and POPSK.  At present, 93 PSK are operating across the country as extended arms of the 36 Passport Offices, thus providing extended reach to passport applicants.  The Ministry in association with the Department of Posts has decided to open 289 Passport Seva Kendras at the Head Post Offices (HPO)/ Post Offices (PO) in the country called ‘Post Office Passport Seva Kendra’ (POPSK). 214 POSPK are functional as on 14 July, 2018.	The passport rules have also been simplified to make it easier for the citizens to get passports. This is at Annexure-I.	Under the Passport Seva Project, a robust information system has been created to offer a bouquet of online passport services as follows:(i) 	Comprehensive information relating to passport application procedure, requirement of supporting documents, applicable fees, location of Passport Offices, PSK, POPSK, police station jurisdiction, etc. is posted on the Portal to make it user-friendly. It is kept updated with Advisories/Notices and Press Releases relating to Passport services developments. Status of applications can be tracked through the Passport Portal.(ii) 	An e-mail based helpdesk facility and a 24x7 National Call Centre has been set up to provide requisite information to citizens.(iii) 	The Passport Seva system sends four free of cost SMS to applicants - (i) at the time of dispatch of passport, (ii) in ‘returned undelivered’ passport cases, (iii) rejection of request for counter delivery cases and (iv) clear Police Verification (PV) report in pre-PV PCC cases or review of PV and clearance by the Passport Issuing Authority (PIA). In addition, a premium optional SMS Service, on nominal payment basis, has been made available to enable citizens to receive alerts and updates regarding detailed progress of their passport applications and pending actions. The service can be availed from any mobile phone.(iv) 	For assistance, citizens can call toll-free helpline number 1800-258-1800.(v) 	The Passport system has interface with the police for verification of personal particulars of applicants and with the India Post for tracking delivery of passports.	The online system and establishment of PSK/POPSK have facilitated better accountability, transparency and streamlining of passport service delivery. This has also helped in issuing error-free and more secured passports. The time taken in issuing passports has progressively decreased since the introduction of online application system, opening of PSK and POPSK and simplification of rules. The Passport Seva Project has won several awards and is seen as a model of people centric service, innovation and Public Private Partnership. *****Annexure-ISimplification of Passport Rules	In order to streamline, liberalize and ease the process of issue of passport, the Ministry of External Affairs has taken a number of steps in the realm of passport policy to ease the process of issue of passports. The details of these steps are given below:-A. Documents in support of proof of Date of Birth	As per the extant statutory provisions of the Passport Rules, 1980, all the applicants born on or after 26/01/1989, in order to get a passport, had to, hitherto, mandatorily submit the Birth Certificate as the proof of Date of Birth (DOB). It has now been decided that all applicants of passports can submit any one of the following documents as the proof of DOB while submitting the passport application:(i) 	Birth Certificate (BC) issued by the Registrar of Births &amp; Deaths or the Municipal Corporation or any other prescribed authority whosoever has been empowered under the Registration of Birth &amp; Deaths Act, 1969 to register the birth of a child born in India;(ii) 	Transfer/School leaving/Matriculation Certificate issued by the school last attended/recognized educational board containing the DOB of the applicant;(iii) 	PAN Card issued by the Income Tax Department with the DOB of applicant;(iv) 	Aadhaar Card/e-Aadhaar having the DOB of applicant;(v) 	Copy of the extract of the service record of the applicant (only in respect of Government servants) or the Pay Pension Order (in respect of retired Government Servants), duly attested/certified by the officer/in-charge of the Administration of the concerned Ministry/Department of the applicant, having his DOB;(vi) 	Driving license issued by the Transport Department of concerned State Government, having the DOB of applicant;(vii) 	Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) issued by the Election Commission of India having the DOB of applicant;(viii) 	Policy Bond issued by the Public Life Insurance Corporations/Companies having the DOB of the holder of the insurance policy.B. Other Changes:(i) 	The online passport application form now requires the applicant to provide the name of father or mother or legal guardian, i.e., only one parent and not both. This would enable single parents to apply for passports for their children and to also issue passports where the name of either the father or the mother is not required to be printed at the request of the applicant.(ii) 	The total number of Annexes prescribed in the Passport Rule, 1980, has been reduced to 9 from the present 15. Annexes A, C, D, E, J, and K have been removed and certain Annexes have been merged.(iii) 	All the annexes that are required to be given by the applicants would be in the form of a self declaration on a plain paper. No attestation/swearing by/ before any Notary/ Executive Magistrate/ First Class Judicial Magistrate would be henceforth necessary.(iv) 	Married applicants would not be required to provide the erstwhile Annexure K or any marriage certificate.(v) 	The passport application form does not require the applicant to provide the name of her/his spouse in case of separated or divorced persons. Such applicants for passports would not be required to provide even the Divorce Decree.(vi) 	In case of children not born out of wedlock, the applicant for the passport of such children should submit only extant Annexure C while submitting the passport application.(vii) 	In case of issue of passport to in-country domestically adopted children, submission of the registered adoption deed would no longer be required. In the absence of any deed to this effect, the passport applicant may give a declaration on a plain paper confirming the adoption.(viii) 	Government servants, who are not able to obtain the Identity Certificate (extant Annexure-A)/ No-Objection Certificate (extant Annexure-G) from their concerned employer and intend to get the passport on urgent basis can now get the passport by submitting a self-declaration in extant Annexure-‘H’ that he/she has given prior Intimation Letter to his/her employer informing that he/she was applying for an ordinary passport to a Passport Issuing Authority.(ix) 	Sadhus/ Sanyasis can apply for a passport with the name of their spiritual Guru mentioned in the passport application in lieu of their biological parent(s) name(s) subject to their providing of at least one public document such as Electors Photo Identity Card (EPIC) issued by the Election Commission of India, PAN card, Aadhaar Card, etc wherein the name of the Guru has been recorded against the column(s) for parent(s) name(s).(x) 	Orphaned children who do not have any proof of DOB such as Birth Certificate or the Matriculation Certificate or the declaratory Court order, may now submit a declaration given by the Head of the Orphanage/Child Care Home on their official letter head of the organization confirming the DOB of the applicant.(xi) 	An applicant for a passport has to submit any one of the documents as mentioned in (A) above as proof of Date of Birth (DOB) while submitting the passport application. The DOB mentioned in the document would be recorded in the passport. In case there is a discrepancy between the DOB previously recorded in the passport and the new proof of DOB submitted by the applicant, the Passport Issuing Authorities (PIA) have been authorized to consider the explanation of each applicant seeking change in the DOB (irrespective of the period that would have lapsed after the issue of the passport) to find the genuineness of the claim and if the PIA is satisfied with the claim and with the document(s) submitted by the applicant in support of the claim, the PIA shall accept all such requests made by the applicant to issue the passport with revised DOB.(xii)	Passports can be now obtained under the ‘Tatkaal’ Scheme without providing the Verification Certificate from a Gazetted Officer, which was required earlier. The documents to be submitted for getting a passport under this Scheme have been notified vide G.S.R. 39(E) dated 18 January, 2018 and O.M. No. VI/401/1/4/2013 dated 23 March 2018 read with O.M. of even number dated 17 April 2018. Applicants may submit minimum three out of the following documents for obtaining passport:(a) 	Aadhaar Card/e-Aaadhar containing the 12 digit Aadhaar number/28-digit Aadhaar Enrolment ID printed on the Aadhaar Enrolment Slip issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).(b) 	Electors Photo Identify Card (EPIC)(c) 	Service Photo Identity Card issued by State or Central Govemment, Public Sector Undertaking, local bodies or Public Limited Companies;(d) 	Scheduled Caste/ Scheduled Tribes/Other Backward Class Certificate;(e) 	Arms License;(f) 	Pension Document such as Ex-servicemen's Pension Book or Pension Payment order, ex-servicemen's widow or dependent Certificate, Old Age pension Order;(g) 	Self-Passport (unrevoked and undamaged):(h) 	Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card;(i) 	Bank/Kisan/Post Office Passbook;(j) 	Student Photo Identity Card issued by an Educational Institution;(k) 	Driving License (valid and within the jurisdiction of State of submission of applicant);(l) 	Birth Certificate issued under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act; and(m) 	Ration Card(xiii)	Now Passports can also be obtained under the Normal scheme on out-of-turn post-Police Verification basis without paying any additional fees on the submission of minimum three documents mentioned in para-xii. *****</description>
